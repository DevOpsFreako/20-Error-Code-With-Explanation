When you encounter an error, it's essential to read the error message carefully to identify the root cause of the problem.
The error message will often provide useful information on the line number where the error occurred, which can help you pinpoint the problematic code. 
Additionally, use tools like set -x to enable debugging mode to see the actual commands that are being executed and identify where the problem is occurring.
