Summary

To identify the type of error indicated by its code or name, you can refer to documentation or 
resources specific to the command, programming language, or system you are working with.

Example, 
if you encounter an error with exit code 127, you could search for "exit code 127 [command/system/language name]" to find relevant documentation or 
resources. The documentation should explain what the error code means and provide guidance on how to resolve the issue.

Similarly, if you encounter an error with a specific name or message, you can search for that name or
message to find relevant information onwhat the error means and how to resolve it.

It's important to keep in mind that error codes and messages can vary depending on the system, command, orprogramming language you are working with.
So it's always a good idea to refer to the specific documentation or resources for that system, command, or language.
